### Nightchord is a python-based music creation software capable of converting a lyric video on Youtube into a [video like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNzXQX542c)

## Introduction

I started working on this project almost 2 years ago, but I just recently started getting back into it after seeing the stats on SoundCloud.

I originally used this project to learn about more advanced Python topics, and the code in this repo is extremely disorganized and confusing.

I'm working on rewriting the way you generate songs to make it easier for others to use.  

This program can generate Nightcore video by inputting one of the following paramters:

 * Youtube URL
 * Artist / Song Name
 * Locally Saved MP4/AVI
 * Locally Saved MP3

You can also pull song names from Billboard Top-X Charts to use for video generation.

Essentially, this programs automates the process of Downloading/Remixing/Transcribing/Uploading Nightcore videos.  I have automated all of these processes using various techniques.  Everything I'm currently using is more of a proof of concept solution rather than a solution that's set to scale.
